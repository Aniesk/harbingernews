					<p>The Theater Company is a terrific and exciting organization whose members are talented and funloving
students wholeheartedly in love with all the different aspects of theater. In addition to
improving performance skills in acting, singing, and dancing, the members of the company learn how
to build and paint scenery, hang and focus lights, and use sound equipment. The Theater company
produces four shows each year: a Drama or Comedy in the fall semester, a mid-year student-written
and directed short play festival called PlayFest, a traditional spring musical, and an end of the year
celebration of classical theater called Shakespeare in the Courtyard. Cast and crew meet according to
published rehearsal schedules, generally five days a week in the afternoons and on Saturday
mornings. Members of the company have a varied range of interests and talents. The company
currently has more than 55 active members of whom 18 are Honors Thespians. To become an Honors
Thespian, a student must maintain better than average grades in all score subjects and participate in
some capacity in all four productions.
