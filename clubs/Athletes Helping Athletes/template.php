					<p>Room: See advisors for details.</p>
					<p>The Athletes Helping Athletes program of Harborfields High School recognizes the role of sports and athletes in developing and encouraging youngsters to be responsible members of their community. In delivering an early intervention drug, alcohol , tobacco and violence prevention program to fifth and sixth grade students, and by processing the issues of sportsmanship, civility, bullying, and teasing, the student-athlete leaders of Athletes Helping Athletes seek to encourage students to stay in school, avoid substance abuse and violence, as well as be respectful of both themselves and others. It is the mission of the student-athlete role models to inspire the youth in our community to make healthy choices, positive decisions, and to have respectful interactions; and consequently, improve the quality of life in our community.</p>
