					<p>Advisor: Mr. Flynn</p> 
					<p>Room: T2</p>
					<p>The Environmental Club meets to discuss environmental issues that are having an impact either locally or nationally. Sometimes, the club writes letters to Congressmen asking them to act on these environmental concerns and they might attend town board meetings when environmental issues are being discussed or voted on. The group is committed to raising awareness of environmental issues throughout the school and is also responsible for various school-wide recycling programs including ink cartridges/toner, cell phones, and paper. The group is often involved in beach clean-ups and beautification projects at the high school. The only requirement to join the Environmental Club is a commitment to the environment.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>This club meets the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays every month at 2:30pm</p>
