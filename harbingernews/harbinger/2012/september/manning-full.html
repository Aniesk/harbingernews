		<h2>The New Father of the HFamily</h2>
		
		<span class="author"><i>By Danielle Yurkew</i></span>

		<div style="text-align: justify;">
		<p>For most students, the first day in Harborfields High school was nothing but nerve wracking. Those four minutes in between classes spent sprinting across the school just so you wont be a second late. The giant seniors who swing their car keys around just to claim authority. Though it is true that the first day in a new environment is usually tough, our new principal, Dr. Rory Manning, is nothing but excited. </p>
		
		<p>The Harborfields news team had the pleasure of talking to Dr. Manning this past week and his enthusiasm about the upcoming school year was impressive. Dr. Manning was the principal of Sachem High School East which is double the student population of Harborfields. He stated, <q>I already feel like I know HF on a more personal level, compared to Sachem where it was difficult to get involved in personal relationships with the large percentage of students. As an outsider, I obviously heard about the outstanding academic achievements and the talented athletic program. These characteristics initially attracted me to Harborfields. Now that I have gotten to know the people more, it is the concept of the HFamily that is so attractive to me. It is something I feel that I am really going to love.</q></p>
		
		<p>Not only does Dr. Manning admire our close-knit atmosphere in Harborfields, but he is blown away by how involved the students and faculty are year round. <q>I've had the pleasure of working closely with student government and I have met with students almost daily.</q> Dr. Manning marveled, <q>whether it be students, teachers, custodians... everybody is talking about the same thing which is just making the student experience the best it could possibly be. I am looking forward to getting to know everybody and seeing how we can evolve over the years, not only academically but socially and emotionally as well.</q></p>
		
		<p>Dr. Manning also made it clear that safety is his primary concern and he is completely open with the vast ideas of students. He stated that he has talked about a wide variety of issues whether it be the homecoming dance, the fundraising that is planned for the year or the clubs that want to be offered. His door is always open to students' suggestions because through them is how he will asses what resources will be necessary in improving the school and student experience.</p>
		
		<p><q>I am very excited to start,</q> exclaimed Dr. Manning, <q>I don't want to wish my life away but at the same time, I could not be any more excited for September fifth.</q> Dr. Manning's enthusiasm is admirable and he only has positive thoughts about this upcoming fall.
