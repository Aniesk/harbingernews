<h1>The Harborfields High School Web Site</h1>
<em>Project started by Alex LaFroscia</em>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this, then you are probably a member of the Harborfields High School web site development team.  Catchy, right?  Probably not, but we don't have a real title, nor are our efforts usually very appreciated.  However, if we ever come up with a nicer name than that, I'll be sure to update this file.</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>My name is Alex LaFroscia, the original creator of this site.  I'm not the first one to run the Harbinger Web Site, and I won't be the last.  However, I am the one to create a Github account for us, and to (hopefully) create the last version of the site that will ever have to be created from scratch.</p>

<p>I won't go into too much detail about the project here and now, but if you want to know more about my history with the project, check out the Wiki page on it.</p>

<h2>Speaking of the Wiki...</h2>
<p>One of the reasosn I chose to host our project on Github was the it gives us a lot more tools that we can use, in order to better communicate about the project.  One of those tools is the Wiki, which is found on a tab at the top of the Github page.  If you click on it, you'll be able to see a lot of information about the project, how it's set up, and how to do certain things.  Check out it â€“ it is meant to be a guide to that I don't have to repeat myself over and over.  Please make use of it!</p>
