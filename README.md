# Master
=============

This is the master branch of our repository. This should be completed code, preferably with as few bugs as possible. This is probably going to be what is on the server, and bugs in the production code is a big no-no.

When you want to add a feature or change something, you should do it on another branch, then merge into development, test, and if it works you can merge development into master.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is, don't mess this branch up. It's kind of important. I'm looking at you, Jake.
