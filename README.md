# Posts
=============

This is the posts branch of the Harbinger website. For now, posts/comments apparently arent going to be ok with the board, so we aren't able to actually keep and refine this feature for the actual site at this time. However, I didn't want to scrap the work I already did, so here's what I have thus far.

Users are able to post on club pages. If the post belongs to the current user, that user can delete the post.

This was going to expand to other pages, such as sport and user pages, but because it wasn't OK with the board, I didn't get to do it.
Also, we were going to do the updating in something closer to real time. The plan was to use JSON, but whatever future people want to use should be fine.

Hopefully, in a couple years, the board will allow us to do something like this, but for now it will live here.
